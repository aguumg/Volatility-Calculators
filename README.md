# ðŸ“Š Volatility Indicators for Crypto Markets

This repository provides a collection of volatility metrics used to analyze cryptocurrency price behavior. It includes both simple return-based indicators and more advanced statistical models, implemented in Python and demonstrated in Jupyter Notebooks.

The repo is structured to support a series of blog posts hosted on [Substack](#) (coming soon), where each post walks through the theory and implementation of key volatility measures in the context of DeFi and crypto markets.

## ðŸ“˜ Covered in Blog Post 1: Intro to Volatility

Implemented in `01_intro_volatility_metrics.ipynb`:

- Log Returns
- Rolling Mean & Std Dev
- Z-Score of Returns
- Normalized Candle Height
- Range Over Price (trend-aware)
- Rate of Change (ROC)
- Average True Range (ATR)
- Efficiency Ratio (ROC / ATR)

Each metric is explained intuitively and visualized using real BTC price data.
